# Automatic Chess Clock (PoC)

The Automatic Chess Clock is a proof-of-concept system designed to detect chess moves automatically and switch the active player's timer without requiring physical clock buttons. The goal of the PoC is to validate the feasibility of using computer vision to monitor a chessboard in real time while remaining board-agnostic and non-invasive.
